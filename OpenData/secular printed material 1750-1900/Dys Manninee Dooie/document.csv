"Dys Manninee dooie, cummaltee Ellan Vannin.",To The Natives Of The Isle Of Man.,
"Gheiney Seyrey,—ayns scrieunyn dys cummaltee yn ellan, er yn laa chaie, ghow me yn reamys dy ghra focklyn giarrey mychione cairys ta eu dys yn “elective franchise,” —ta shen dy ghra, privilege dy reigh as dy churt stiagh Kiar-as-feeid ny cheerey ain. Ayns yn scrieunyn cheddin hass mee magh noi, as dob mee firrinys goan va loayrit liorish unnane jeh ny hard leighderyn ny mastey eu, “de beagh yn privilege shoh mollaght as cha nee bannaght.” ","Gentlemen,—In a letter to the imhabitants of the Island, the other day, I took the liberty of saying a few short words about the right you have to the elective franchise, that is to say, the privilege to elect and to put in the Keys of the country. In the same letter I stood in opposition against and I denied the truth of words that were spoken by one of the chief leaders amongst you, “that this privilege would be a curse and not a blessing.”",
"Va yn resooney ayms er ny levallal noi yn Chiar-as-feeid, fir oik nagh vel shuish ayns aght erbee reigh ny pointeil; agh fir oik ta reigh as pointeil ad hene dy hassoo syn oik cheddin son ooilley laaghyn nyn mea, cha vel ocksan eu dy churt daue ny sneay dy churt orroo. T’ad jannoo leighyn, ta kiangley shuish as nyn gloan, veih sheeloghe dys sheeloghe. Va goayn yn leighder wheeish as gra, dy beagh yn phooar eu ny mastey eu hene, voish tra gys traa dy reigh as dy phonteil Kiar-as-feeid ny cheerey, dy hoie as nyn leah as er nyn goontey, son tra veagh er ny enmys, as yn phooar ve freilt dy caghlaa ad, my yinnagh shu myner nagh row ad jannoo nyn gooid share son foayst ny cheerey. Va ny goan loayrit, ta me ginsh diu, gra “dy beagh yn phooar shoh —pooar ta slane cairys eu huick— mollaght, as cha nee bannaght.”","     My argument was levelled against the Keys, officials that you have not in any way elected or appointed, but officials who choose and appoint themselves to stand in the same office for all the days of their lives (for life). A rebuke of yours does not upset them. They make laws, binding upon you and your children from generation to generation. The lawyer’s words were as much as saying that if you had the power amongst yourselves, from time to time, to choose and to appoint the Keys of the country, to sit out on our behalf and on our account , for a time that would be named, and the power being maintained to change them, if you observed that they weren’t doing their utmost for the benefit of the country. The words were said, I’m telling you, to say “that this power would be—a power that you have an absolute right to—a curse, and not a blessing.” ",
"     Cha jean ym reeisht gentrail ayns cooish liour dy phrowal neufirrinys ny goan shoh, agh ayns aght giare dy hoiagh reau reddyn yinnagh cheeit mygeayrt, dy beagh yn phooar shoh ec ny Manninee, dy reigh Kiar-as-feeid ny cheerey, chammah as yn phooar dy churt dys lhiattee unnane erbee jeu, ec kione yn tra v’ad dy hassoo, nagh beagh shiu credjal va er yannoo eh phaart son foays ny cheerey.","     I will not enter again into a long discourse of proving the false assertion of these words, but as a summary to set before you things that come around, were the Manx to have this power, to choose the Keys of the country, as well as the power to put aside anyone of them, at the end of the time they were to stand, were you not to believe that he had done his part for the benefit of the country.  ",
"     Lhissaghin hoshiaght gra, dy beagh eh cairagh dy stowal yn “elective franchise,” ny yn chairys dy votal son fir oik yn Chiar-as-feeid, er dy chooilley ghooiney ayns dagh skeerey veagh ayns possession ayns yn chairys ec eh hene, as da hene bentyn thalloo, thieyn, ny intackyn fieu daa-eeid skillyn sy vlein; as myrgeddin er dagh cotler-thallooin veagh geek queig puint meyll, as erskyn. Ayns ny baljyn mairgee lhissagh yn chairys sho ve ec dagh cummaltagh geek queig puint sy vlein dy veyll thie, as erskyn.","     I ought first to say, that it would be fair to bestow the “elective franchise,” or the right to vote for officials of the Keys, on every man in each parish who would posses in his own right, and himself owning land, buildings, or intacks worth forty shillings a year; and also on every tenant of  lands who would be paying five pounds in rent, and above. In towns, every householder paying five pounds and above per annum of house rent should have this right. ",
"Yn reigh shoh dy ve jeant, yn slane Kiar-as-feeid dy ve votit er nyn son, as jerrey dy ve currit er yn pholl ayns un laa; as slane pooar ve oc dy hassoo seose ayns ynnid nyn vir cheerey son three bleaney dy chra, ny sloo [1] ny veagh ad currit as bree, as poll noa ve ordyrit liorish Keannoort ny cheerey. ","This choice being made, the entire Keys to be voted for, and the poll closed in one day; and for them to have complete power to  represent their countrymen for a duration of three years, until they would be made void dissolved, and a new poll to be ordered by the Governor of the land. ","[1] ny sloo—‘less’, here this likely a mistake in translation for ‘until’—derrey / dys / gys ['unless' in the original English. MWW]."
"     Ta sho myr oir mooie, ny sketch giare, jeh yn plan lhissagh ve er ny ghoil dy stowal ny mastey eu yn “franchise,” ny yn phooar dy reih Kiar-as-feeid ny cheerey; dy ve lheint seose ny lurg shen; as t’eh poor ta cairys, as slane cairys eu huckey fegoosh foayr voish dooinney erbee. ","     This is as an outline, or short sketch, of the plan that should be taken to bestow amongst you the ‘franchise’, or the power to elect the Keys of the country; to be filled out subsequently; and it is a power that is your right, and you have absolute right to it without favour from any man. ",
     Nee’m nish genmys gha ny three jeh ny vondeishyn yinnagh gerree voish yn plan sho dy ve currit ayns bree. ,     I will now name a few of the advantages that arise from this plan to be enacted. ,
"     Veagh yn Chiar-as-feeid eisht ayns firrinys ny hassoo ayns ynnid yn theay; yinnagh ad cur cleash gys accanyn yn slegh, as lesh daanys shassoo seose as nyn leah, noi tranlaasee erbee veagh er nyn vaggyrt nyn oi, as er son dagh nhee veagh ymmirchagh as femoil dy ve jeant er nyn son. ","     The Keys would then truly represent the people; they would give an ear (lend and ear) to the complaints of the people, and with boldness stand up on their behalf, against any tyranny that would threaten against them, and for everything that would be required and needed to be done for them. ",
"     Myr t’ad nish er nyn reih, cha vel ad jannoo yn cheid unnane jeh ny reddyn sho, as cha loayst daue yn unnane elley y yannoo.","     As they are now selected, they do not do the former, and they dare not do the latter. ",
,,
"     Currit ayns pooar liorish yn theay, yinnagh ad jeaghyn lurg airgid cadjin ny cheerey as shasso seose ayns nyn ynnid, as goil karrail dy beagh coontey firrinagh currit jeh, as dy rou eh er ny varrail son ny reddyn smoo ymmirch as femoil.","     Put into power by the people, they would look after the common revenues of the country and stand up in their stead, and take care that a true account would be given of it, and that it was spent for most pressing and needed things. ",
"     Veagh yn phonteil jeh trusteeghyn ny raadjyn moarey ayns laue yn sleih; as veagh oc fo’n charail oc ny keeshyn troggit vou hene dy yannoo raadjyn noa, as dy chummal seose ny raadjyn cheddin. Veagh oc marish sho yn phonteil jeh dagh fer oik bentyn dys ny raadjyn fo ny hard reiltee, er reigh[2] da’n phointeil cheddin ve liorish skeeraghyn, liorish sheidjinyn, ny liorish committee er coontey yn slane ellan.   ","     The people would have the power of the appointment of the Road Trustees; and they would have under their care (regulation) the taxes raised from themselves to make new roads, and to maintain the same roads. They would have, moreover, the appontment of every official connected to the roads under the Board, whether it is decided that the said appointment be by parishes, by sheadings, or by committee on account of the whole Island.","[2] er reigh—‘whether chosen’?. Unattested elswhere in the corpus. This piece was written as a free translation of a letter by the same ‘Brittanicus’ that appeared above the Manx version. In the English letter the writer notes: “These few hints may suffice for the present; and as they are intended chiefly for the eye of natives, who may not so readily appreciate them in the language of the Saxon. I, who am somewhat conversant with the dialect of the ancient Gael, have endeavoured to submit them underneath in that tongue, which must be enshrined in the heart and affection of every Manxman.” The equivalent phrase in the English reads “whether chosen by parishes, by sheadings or by one general committee elected for the whole Island”."

"Veagh ec yn sleih yn chairys dy reigh daue hene Briwnyn beggey ny baljyn mairgee, as persoonyn jeh yn un oik fud yn cheer, marish dagh fer ayns oik injyl trooid balley as cheer.","     The people would have the right to choose for themselves the chief magistrates of the towns, and persons of the same office throughout the country, as well as each subordinate officer through town and country.",
"     Cha beagh sy traa shen, keesh, ta goit rish dy ve ymmirchagh as femoil son cummal seose boghtyn yn ellan, cur aggle as creau ayns ny hirinnee as ny cummaltee, son wheeish as dy beagh yn cheesh cheddin er ny ordrail as ny chroggal liouroo hene dagh blein, ny keeshyn cheddin dy ve currit er y thallo, er jagheeyn, as er meyll thieyn, —yn ayrn smoo dy hutchym, myr lhissagh eh, yn sleigh jeh’n verchys smoo. Veagh yn slane airgit er ny rhein liorish offisheeryn er ny phonteil liorish yn sleih; as son wheeish as dy beagh ayrn jeh’n cheesh shoh tuttym orroo hene veagh eh yn vondeish oc dy ve cha sparrallagh as ayns nyn booar ayns barrail yn airgit.",,"     There would then be a tax, that is admitted to be imperative and necessary for the support of the poor of the Island, causing fear and trembling for the farmers and the householders, inasmuch as the same tax would be ordered and raised by themselves each year, the same taxes to be put on the land, on tithes, and on house rentals—the heaviest proportion to fall, as it ought to, on the wealthiest people. The entire revenue would be disbursed by overseers appointed by the people; and insomuch as a portion of this tax would be falling upon themselves, it would be to their advantage to be as economic as is in their power in the expenditure of the money. ",

"     Veagh keeshyn son cummal seose ny baljyn-mairgee er ny chroggal s’y naght cheddin, agh veagh ad sho ayns y clane er ny eek liorish cummaltee yn valley. ","     Taxes for supporting the towns would be raised in the same way, but these would be paid in full by the inhabitants of the town.",

","     I have written these short words to you, who are native Manx people in the mother tongue (Manx), undertaking that that which I wish to explain to you will be understood better in that language. ",
"     Foddee eh ve dy jean shiu clastyn voym keart ennagh elley mychoine ny reddyn sho; ayns y tra t’ayn creid shiu me dy ve,","     It may be that you will hear from me about these things some other time, in the meantime, believe me to be,",
