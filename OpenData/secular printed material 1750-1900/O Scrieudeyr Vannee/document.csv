Resoon lesh ônid as lambaanys dooie ; ,"Reason with innocence and due childlikeness,",

"Ayns ynnyd mergey ersyn[2], ghied ersooyl,","Instead of corroding him, stealing away,","[2] mergey ersyn – meaning unclear, could be corroding him [Cowper's original has 'curses' here: 'not with curses on his art who stole'. MWW]."
"Lesh crout y Jouyll,—myr maarlagh cheet ny chooyl,","With the trickery of the Devil, like a thief, coming behind him,",
"Yn stoyr dy ynrickys va ayns e chree, ","The store of righteousness that was in his heart,",
As cleayn’ yn annym beayn veih oghrish sheeant e YEE.,And diverts the immortal soul from the blessed bosom of his GOD.,
